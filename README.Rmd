# TADkitShinyApp

The goal of TADkitShinyApp is to visualize visualzie HiC matrix from mcool file in an interactive apps. 
In other words, you can visualize HiC matrices without having to write a single bit of code. 

However, as mcool files are very large, the web application cannot be deployed online and must be installed locally.

## Installation

You can install TADkitShinyApp from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Nico-FR/TADkitShinyApp")
```

## Use

To run the apps, you just need to run this function in R console: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
TADkitShinyApp::TADkitShinyApp()
```

First, you need to select the mcool file and the application will plot the first chromosome at the hight resolution. It also get metadatas from the mcool, which are:
  * available chromosome matrices, 
  * chromosome sizes,
  * available resolutions (bin width),
  * available balancing vectors according to their names.
  
## Example

![](figures/TADkitShinyApp.png)   


In the order (top left panel), you can intuitively change :
  * chromosome, 
  * resolution,
  * plot balancing counts (if available),
  * select balancing vectors,
  * plot count values or log2(counts),
  * increase/decrease plot size,
  * load and plot upper domains as red triangles (tabulated, no header) with 3 columns (chromosome, domain start, domain end),
  * load and plot lower domains as red triangles (lower part of the matrix),
  * removed domains from the plot,
  * load and plot bedgraph track (one or more files, tabulated, no header) with 4 columns (chromosome, start, end, score),
  * load and plot a second bedgraph track,
  * load and plot bed track (one or more files, tabulated, no header) with 3 or more columns (chromosome, start, end),
  * ...
